# Spam_Text_Classification

 The spam text classification project typically involves the following steps:

   1.  Data collection: Collecting a dataset of SMS messages, labeled as either spam or legitimate.

   2.  Data preprocessing: Preprocessing the dataset to clean and prepare the text data for the machine learning algorithm. This step may involve tasks such as removing         stop words, stemming, and tokenization.

   3.  Feature extraction: Extracting features from the preprocessed text data, such as bag-of-words, tf-idf, or word embeddings.

   4.  Model training: Training the Naive Bayes algorithm on the extracted features, along with Laplace smoothing.

   5.  Model evaluation: Evaluating the performance of the model using various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

   6.  Model deployment: Deploying the trained model in a real-world setting, such as a mobile network or email service provider, to filter out spam messages.

The spam text classification project aims to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify incoming messages as either spam or legitimate. This project uses the Naive Bayes algorithm and Laplace smoothing technique to build a robust and accurate classification system.

The spam text classification system can be used in various settings where there is a need to filter out unwanted messages or emails. For example, it can be used by email service providers to automatically filter out spam emails or by mobile network operators to block spam SMS messages.
